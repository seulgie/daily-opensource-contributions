# Open Source Contributions

This repository is a record of my open-source contributions. I am contributing to various open-source projects on a daily basis to improve my skills, learn new things, and give back to the community.

## Contributions

Each contribution is placed in its own folder based on the project name. The goal is to maintain a log of what I worked on, why I made certain decisions, and how it contributes to the project.

## Why Open Source?

I believe in the power of open-source software and its ability to solve real-world problems. Contributing to open-source projects helps me grow, and I want to be part of communities that work together to create innovative solutions for the future.

## How to Contribute

If you're interested in contributing to this repository or any of the projects I am contributing to, feel free to open issues, fork the repository, or submit pull requests. Let's collaborate and make an impact!
