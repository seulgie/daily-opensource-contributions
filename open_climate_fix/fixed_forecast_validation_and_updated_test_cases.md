### Commit Title:
Fixed Forecast Validation and Updated Test Cases

### Summary:
**Problem:** The elevation test was added, but existing fluctuation validation code caused errors in tests.  
**Approach:** Fixed issues in the fluctuation validation to ensure all tests pass, while preserving the elevation check.  
**Changes:**  
- Fixed datetime index mismatch between forecast values and solar position data.
- Ensured consistency in environment variable names for the sun elevation threshold.
- Updated test cases to handle correct datetime indexing and reflect accurate fluctuation thresholds.
- Fluctuation validation logic fixed to handle thresholds for ≥250 MW and ≥500 MW.
- Successfully passed the elevation test.

**Code:**
- Updated `forecast_compiler.py` and `test_forecast_compiler.py` for correct datetime alignment and fluctuation threshold handling.
- Adjusted `test_validate_forecast_with_warning` and `test_validate_forecast_with_exception` to pass the intended fluctuation validation.
